# Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown
I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed a Power BI project   focused on breaking down insights from a Data Professional Survey! 💡    🔍 The goal of this project was to analyze key aspects of the data profession — including job roles, tools used, salary trends, and work-life balance — using interactive and insightful visualizations.
✅ Tools & Techniques Used:
Power BI: Data modeling, DAX calculations, custom visuals, slicers, and drill-through pages
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, filtered irrelevant responses, and ensured data integrity
Dashboard Design: Built an interactive dashboard to allow users to explore metrics like:
* Popular job titles in data
* Most used programming tools & technologies
* Regional salary distribution
* Career satisfaction trends
